      <description>On October 24 2007, Sarah Gray, a Linguistics and Philosophy student from MIT disappears mysteriously. Her last email was sent to her friend. The subject said, “Hard to say…”, the body said, “I can’t say much right now, I can’t say what happened, I’m being watched, I’m going somewhere, where no one can find me, but I’ll be here somewhere. If you ever find me, say those words and I’ll know” and two PNG files were attached to the email.</description>

      <description>String Puller: Hello my lovely digital sleuths, our &amp;ldquo;Machine&amp;rdquo; is pointing us towards certain incidents from the past while performing a data analysis on a state sponsored cabal. So far we are not able to understand why it&amp;rsquo;s giving us these results. We tried to look for discrepancies or errors within our system, but surprisingly everything’s in the place and the information is relevant. So these results from the “Machine” should mean something, can you crack this?</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;String Puller:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello my lovely digital sleuths, our &amp;ldquo;Machine&amp;rdquo; is pointing us towards certain incidents from the past while performing a data analysis on a state sponsored cabal.

We tried to look for discrepancies or errors within our system, but surprisingly everything’s in the place and the information is relevant. So these results from the “Machine” should mean something, can you crack this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2005: Approximately 1,005 people die in Iraq when Shi’ites stampede off a bridge over the Tigris river in Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2012: Port Said Stadium Disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2022: Riot at Indonesia soccer match kills 129.&lt;/p&gt;
