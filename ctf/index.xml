      <description>On October 24 2007, Sarah Gray, a Linguistics and Philosophy student from MIT disappears mysteriously. Her last email was sent to her friend. The subject said, “Hard to say…”, the body said, “I can’t say much right now, I can’t say what happened, I’m being watched, I’m going somewhere, where no one can find me, but I’ll be here somewhere. If you ever find me, say those words and I’ll know” and two PNG files were attached to the email.</description>
