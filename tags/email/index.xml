      <content>&lt;p&gt;Even in the age of instant messaging apps, email still serves as an
‘official’ medium to communicate between two parties. It’s ironic
that electronic mail has not lost its charm till date within the
barrage of privacy respecting encrypted chat messengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, email services nowadays are adapting to the new age norm of
privacy and making their products more privacy hardened with
encrypted mailboxes or hard to locate data centers and so on. But
the core technology behind email hasn’t changed since its inception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-steps&#34;&gt;First Steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has become a tradition for any experienced or rookie
investigators to start their investigation just by ‘Googling’ stuff
out. Finding information about emails is no different, an email that
has to be investigated could be played around in a variety of forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raw Email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a plain email is put in the search bar, the results are limited
to the fact that how often that email has been used in public and
how open it is to the public. To simplify, if the email is used on
multiple blogs, academic websites, personal websites, social media,
paste bins, forums etc,. There is a strong chance of retrieving the
information about the keywords in the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/articles/email/1.png&#34; alt=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above image, it’s evident that Google search engine
retrieved the information with some keywords involved within the
email. It recognized some keywords like ‘john’, ‘snow’, and ‘gmail’.
But it didn’t point towards the exact email; why? Because the exact
email wasn’t open for viewing in the wild. Interestingly it also
tried to match the keywords from different social media such as
Twitter and Pininterest. Endless scrolling and jumping to each page
might lead to the exact email or might not, and that’s the
limitation for the investigators and a slight win for privacy
settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding quotes around the email tells the search engine to look for
the exact keywords that’s specified within the quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/articles/email/2.png&#34; alt=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, with quotes the email led to one of the primary
sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, using quotes around an email tries to retrieve specific
information if it exists on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it? Is it that easy to retrieve information on anyone just by
Googling the email address? Well, the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/articles/email/3.png&#34; alt=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/articles/email/4.png&#34; alt=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As aforementioned, Google or any search engines could retrieve the
information only if they are present on the internet. It depends on
a lot of factors such as one’s privacy settings, social engagement,
relevance, repeated usage of the same email, or being public and so
on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;dorking&#34;&gt;Dorking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google dorking is an advanced way of searching results on the
internet. Other searching engines such as DuckDuckGo, Bing,
Startpage, Brave Search and so on could also be used for dorking.
Basically, dorking lets the user to concise the search results and
provide the accurate result as possible. And dorking is not only
limited to search engines, prominent social media platforms like
Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, Vkontakte etc,. have their own set of
dorks. Yet again, it depends on the information that’s already
available and privacy measures of the user. An article about
advanced search operators/dorks could be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://theamoghavarsha.medium.com/advanced-search-operators-1cb514c6cda8&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;potential-places-to-look-for-email&#34;&gt;Potential Places To Look For Email&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Public Files – intext:”jack@twitter.com” filetype:pdf OR filetype:docx OR filetype:xls
• Leaked databases
• Online forums
• Academic websites
• Unfortunately, sometimes on medical websites
• Government websites
• Job search websites
• Automated tools
• Social media
• Chat apps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several tools on the internet that promise to provide much
more information about an email address than just Googling. A caveat
here is, those tools are also scraping the data from the internet
probably with better scraping methods and algorithms. These tools
also change every now and then, due to the changes made from the
product/service provider’s end (email) or changes made in their own
code(tools). And it’s not new to the OSINT community if some service
goes down or becomes redundant, there’ll always be new tools which
could be more or less efficient and that depends on various factors
that are discussed in the previous paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tools to find information on emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://epieos.com/&#34;&gt;Epieos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hunter.io/email-finder&#34;&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spiderfoot.net/&#34;&gt;SpiderFoot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.maltego.com/&#34;&gt;Maltego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://anymailfinder.com/&#34;&gt;Anymailfinder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://intelx.io/&#34;&gt;IntelligenceX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;miscellaneous-techniques&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous Techniques&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it stalking or curiosity to know, some platforms such as Skype,
lets their users to search usernames or emails of other users. Even
in Gmail, some recommendations appear while one types an email for
the first time. Some apps also provide information about other users
when one’s contacts are synced. There could be many other apps out
there which provide a functionality to search for emails or
usernames. Another trick could be by changing language in inspect
element, or changing geographical location using proxies or VPNs to
fetch country specific results. Last but not the least, using the
power of other search engines and web scrapers along with Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;final-words&#34;&gt;Final Words&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email investigation through publicly available information is tricky
and prone to many false positives. This is because of the fact that
email service providers are becoming more closed to protect their
users’ privacy. And also, most of the search engines out there are
not &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source&#34;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;, it means no one knows how their algorithms work or how exactly they query information time to time and how a particular
information is queried. This is a challenge for many SEO experts and
email marketers to update themselves and understand how search
engines function and change overtime. There are dorks, but again
their use cases are limited. But the use of emails seems to not stop
anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
